A new feature in SharePoint 2013 is „Following“. Users can follow nearly everything in SharePoint 2013. Not so nice is the fact that you only can get an overview of WHAT you are following using your MySite. 

A more detailed description about the Following Feature can be found on my blog: http://www.sharepointtalk.net/2013/07/i-am-following.html

You get a JSON result set with information which documents, persons and sites the user fired the query is following.
Using this JSON result and some jQuery magic we can generate a WebPart containing this information in a list view or in METRO style
